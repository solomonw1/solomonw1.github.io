## Solomon Wood's website

This website will show my blog, and other things I am doing.
Projects that I am working on will be here:

### Projects

**muCmd**
A simple shell/command processor.
It is not currently online, but it will be available in a few weeks.

**muBuild**
A very useful build tool, written in Python.
It uses a simple syntax, and reads the 'MuFile' in the current directory.
While I do not expect many people to use it, it is a very good alternative
to GNU Make.

It is online, at https://github.com/solomonw1/MuBuild

*That is all for the moment*
